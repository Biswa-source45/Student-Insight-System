## CSV File Format

The application processes two CSV files:

1. **Class Test Scores (Example CSV Format):**

   | Regno | AccYear | Dept | Subject1 | Subject2 | ... |
   | ----- | ------- | ---- | -------- | -------- | --- |
   | 12345 | 2024    | CSE  | 78       | 85       | ... |

2. **Internal Marks (Example CSV Format):**

   | Regno | AccYear | Dept | Subject1 | Subject2 | ... |
   | ----- | ------- | ---- | -------- | -------- | --- |
   | 12345 | 2024    | CSE  | 80       | 90       | ... |

## Future Enhancements

- Add database support for long-term storage.
- Implement student login for personalized reports.
- Include predictive analysis using AI.
